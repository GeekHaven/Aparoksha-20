Aparoksha also holds TopCoder <span>Humblefool Cup</span>,a 2-tier ACM-ICPC style national level coding contest organised in the honour of Harsha Suryanarayana, an alumnus of IIIT Allahabad, known to the world as one of the greatest coders India has ever produced.</p>

					<p>Technology is best when it brings people together'. In keeping with this motto, Aparoksha also organises a Tech Tour, an initiative taken by the Technical Society of IIIT Allahabad to conduct workshops and talks in various schools and colleges across India to increase technical awareness, build enthusiasm in people and give back to the society.</p>
